## Course List Plus

## Description
Our product would be in the form of a mobile application that the customer
could download for free. Moreover, this application would be available for both android and Ios
and would provide various features addressing the main issues we found students had with
course registration. Course List Plus is an intuitive app for William and Mary
students that helps them easily find the classes that they need and can fit into their schedule.

## Technology
Some of the languages that we would use would be Java for the Android side and Swift for the IOS side. One of the softwares that we use to develop the Project would be Android Studios. To get all the courses available, we would work with the current OpenCourseList that WM uses.

## References
Some of the references we would use to develop our Project is OpenCourseList, Coursicle, and RateMyProfessor. Using these we develop lots of the features that customers have said they enjoy and using their opinions we also integrate into our Projects, what these systems currently lack.
